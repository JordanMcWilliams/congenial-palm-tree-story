JORDANS STORY
Once upon a time there was a boy named John who loved to go swimming.
He loved swimming so much that he wanted to swim everyday. One day he 
convinced his mother to take him swimming in the Atlantic ocean.

Unfortunately, John didn't see a riptide which propelled him fast away from the beach.

“Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in 
the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, 
you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of,
babies-“God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.” – Kurt Vonnegut, God 
Bless You, Mr. Rosewater

Decided to be kind, John went swimming in the Atlantic ocean. In his 
imagination the ocean would be no different from the earth -- every
one would be friendly and would smile at him. Things are different
here in the ocean. He met a shark and it tried to kill him.
