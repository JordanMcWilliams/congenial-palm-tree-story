JORDANS STORY
Once upon a time there was a boy named John who loved to go swimming.
He loved swimming so much that he wanted to swim everyday. One day he 
convinced his mother to take him swimming in the Atlantic ocean.

“Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-“God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.” – Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater
